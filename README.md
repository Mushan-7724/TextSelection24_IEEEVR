# TextSelection24_IEEEVR
This project is my Master's project and is supervised by Hai-Ning Liang, supported by Rongkai Shi.
This project was published as a paper of the IEEE VR 2024 Conference.[Exploring Controller-based Techniques for Precise and Rapid Text Selection in Virtual Reality](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494188). 

In this paper, we proposed three controller-based text selection methods: Joystick Movement, Depth Movement, and Wrist Orientation.
